This a pseudo student database. You can add, delete, edit and view students. 

In this assignment, I was able to make a pseudo database. You can add and look at other current students. It's like a school database, where you can look at students and everything about them. There are photos that attempt to make it look like a legtimate website. 

I planned to have an administrator account to have unique powers that other accounts would not have. For example, an admin account would be able to add, delete, and view other students. Basic accounts will only have access to viewing the information. However, I was not successfully able to implement the log in page.

I tried to implement a login page. There's a user account class that is supposed to create, hold, and check the account credentials. I was attempting to follow a tutorial to create the log in. However, the tutorial used quite a bit of libraries that I did not have initially installed. After installing them and following along, my code would not work. There would be compile errors and it was just a mess. When the code did compile, my website would not work.
My thought process was like this: I would have the website ask for a username and password and store it somewhere. When a user would try to log in, then it would be compared to a list of stored names and passwords.

There is no published website. The code must be downloaded and ran in debug mode to see the website.

Thank you.
